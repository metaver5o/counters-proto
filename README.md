# Bitcoin Counters — Indexer & Wallet

**Bitcoin Counters** are numbered inscriptions — files stored in Bitcoin witness
data (a `COUNT` envelope) — bound to a Counterparty asset. The inscription number
is assigned in sequence; the file is its content; the asset is the handle by
which it is identified, owned, and traded.

This tool **indexes** them (parse → join → number → store), **mints** and
**transfers** them using a taproot (BIP86) wallet kept inside **Bitcoin Core**
(Core holds the keys and signs; this is the same wallet `bitcoin-cli` manages),
and **serves** a web explorer plus a read-only JSON API.

## How it works

For each block (ascending):

1. **Parse** — in each transaction, scan the inputs' witness data for a valid
   `COUNT` envelope
   (`OP_FALSE OP_IF "COUNT" <0x01 content_type> [<0x02 asset>] <0x00> <body…> OP_ENDIF …`).
   The optional `0x02` tag names a target asset and marks a *reinscription*
   (see below).
2. **Join** — for each tx with **exactly one** valid envelope (across all its inputs),
   bind it to the Counterparty issuance in the **same transaction** (matched by
   `txid`). The block's issuances are fetched once and each candidate is looked
   up by its `txid`, so the asset is whatever that transaction itself created.
3. **Validate (via Counterparty Core, the oracle)** — the issuance must be
   `status == "valid"`, the asset's **first/creation** issuance
   (`asset_events` contains `creation`), and not `BTC`/`XCP`.
4. **Number & store** — assign the next gap-free number (from 0), write the
   file to a content-addressed blob store, and insert the record into SQLite.

We never reimplement Counterparty consensus — **Counterparty Core** decides
issuance validity, asset identity, and ownership. ("Bitcoin Core" is the
separate Bitcoin node; the two are always named in full to avoid confusion.)

### Reinscriptions

A counter can also be attached to an **existing** asset you already own — a
*reinscription*. Here the `COUNT` envelope carries an extra `0x02` tag naming
the target asset, and the transaction carries **no Counterparty message** at
all. The indexer authorises it by proving the transaction spent an input from
the asset's **owner (issuance-rights holder) as of that block** — reconstructed
from Counterparty's issuance history (creation → reissuances → ownership
transfers). It is *ownership*, not token balance, that grants the right, and
ownership is checked at the height of the inscription, so a later transfer can
neither retroactively authorise nor invalidate it.

Each reinscription is a new, permanently-numbered counter, so one asset can
back many counters. The lowest-numbered counter on an asset is its *original*;
any later ones are reinscriptions (the explorer lists them all on the asset).
Mint one with `inscribe --reinscribe --asset <ASSET>` (see Usage).

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- A synced **bitcoind** with `txindex=1` (RPC reachable; cookie auth supported)
- A synced **Counterparty Core** v2 API

```bash
pip install -e .          # installs deps + the `counters` console command
```

## Run with Docker

The repo ships a `Dockerfile` and a `docker-compose.yml` with two services:

- **`counters`** — the web explorer + read-only JSON API on port `8082`.
- **`indexer`** — the indexing engine (runs `index --from-genesis`); needs a
  reachable **bitcoind** and **Counterparty Core**.

```bash
cp .env.example .env             # set your bitcoind / Counterparty Core endpoints
docker compose up -d --build     # build + start both services
docker compose up -d counters    # ...or just the explorer (no backends required)
docker compose logs -f counters  # follow logs
docker compose down              # stop
```

The explorer is then at `http://127.0.0.1:8082`. The index (SQLite + blobs)
persists in the `counters-data` volume, mounted at `/data` inside the
containers. On Linux, `host.docker.internal` resolves to the Docker host (wired
up via `extra_hosts`), so the defaults in `.env.example` point at bitcoind /
Core running on the host.

> Compose forwards the connection and indexer-behaviour variables from `.env`
> (`BTC_RPC_*`, `CP_API_URL`, `COUNTER_POLL_INTERVAL`, `COUNTER_CONFIRMATIONS`).
> The `indexer` service sets its start floor with `--from-genesis` rather than
> `COUNTER_START_HEIGHT`.

## Configuration (environment variables)

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `BTC_RPC_URL` | `http://127.0.0.1:8332` | bitcoind JSON-RPC URL |
| `BTC_COOKIE_FILE` | `~/.bitcoin/.cookie` | bitcoind cookie (preferred auth) |
| `BTC_RPC_USER` / `BTC_RPC_PASSWORD` | — | fallback if no cookie |
| `CP_API_URL` | `http://127.0.0.1:4000` | Counterparty Core v2 API |
| `COUNTER_DATA_DIR` | `data/` | SQLite + blobs location |
| `COUNTER_START_HEIGHT` | `955251` | first block a fresh scan starts at |
| `COUNTER_CONFIRMATIONS` | `0` | blocks behind tip to stay |
| `COUNTER_POLL_INTERVAL` | `15` | seconds between tip polls in `run` |

> A fresh scan starts at the **counters-proto genesis block 955251** (counter
> #0; by protocol nothing valid precedes it — same as `--from-genesis`). Move
> the floor with `--from-taproot` (block 709632 — no taproot reveal can exist
> earlier) or `COUNTER_START_HEIGHT` (`0` for an exhaustive scan). Stored
> progress always wins, so this only applies to a fresh DB — pass `--restart`
> to wipe the index (DB + blobs) and rebuild from genesis.

## Usage

Invoke as `counters-proto <command>` after `pip install -e .`, or equivalently
`python -m counters_proto <command>`.

```bash
# --- indexing ---
counters-proto index -v                                  # scan from genesis (block 955251), then follow the tip
counters-proto index --from-taproot                      # scan from taproot activation instead (fresh DB only)
counters-proto index --restart                           # wipe the index (DB + blobs) and rebuild from genesis
counters-proto sync --stop-at 720000                     # one-shot catch-up (bounded for tests)

# --- reads (need only a synced index) ---
counters-proto status                                    # bitcoind / Counterparty / index heights

counters-proto info 0 --raw > cat.png                     # stream the file bytes
counters-proto info 0 --save cat.png                      # write the file to disk
