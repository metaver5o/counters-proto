"""`counters-proto wallet inscribe` — mint a counter from a file (commit + reveal).

Flow (build ref §5, CLI ref §3), designed to work from a single funding UTXO:
  1. Build the COUNT envelope tapscript from the file; derive the P2TR commit
     address (builder.py).
  2. Build + sign the COMMIT (Core funds it): it spends the wallet's BTC and
     produces two outputs — the tiny P2TR commit output (which the reveal will
     script-spend to expose the envelope) and the wallet CHANGE output.
  3. That change output becomes the reveal's vin[0] = the Counterparty *source*
     (so issued tokens + ownership land on a wallet address). Compose the
     issuance as a legacy OP_RETURN pinned to it (RC4 key = its txid) and copy
     the destinations-then-OP_RETURN outputs verbatim.
  4. Build the reveal: vin[0] = the commit's change output (signed by Core),
     vin[1] = the commit output (taproot script path, signed here with the
     ephemeral reveal key); then our own change back to the wallet.
  5. Package-validate [commit, reveal] with testmempoolaccept, then broadcast
     commit + reveal (CPFP) — or with --dry-run stop and print the hex.

Key custody stays in Bitcoin Core; we only sign the ephemeral script-path input.
Numeric (free) assets use the commit's own change as the source. Named assets
burn 0.5 XCP, so they instead use a wallet UTXO whose address already holds the
XCP as the source (reveal vin[0]); the commit is sized to fund the reveal and
the XCP UTXO is locked so funding never spends it.
