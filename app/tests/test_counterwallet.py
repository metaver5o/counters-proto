"""Counterwallet / Freewallet / Rare Pepe derivation.

These wallets use the Electrum-v1 wordlist ONLY for entropy, then derive keys
via BIP32 at m/0'/0/i with COMPRESSED 1... P2PKH addresses — verified against
Counterwallet's own mnemonic.js and the community `bip32utils` recovery helper
(the reference `openWallet`: unhexlify(toHex(mn_decode)) -> HMAC-SHA512("Bitcoin
seed") -> m/0' -> m/0'/0 -> m/0'/0/i).

The vectors below are locked so a future refactor can't silently change the
derivation (which would send users to empty addresses).
